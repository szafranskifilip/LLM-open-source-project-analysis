The table summarizes key data for a selection of GitHub repositories, focusing on their popularity, contribution metrics, and classification. It provides repository names, descriptions, creation dates, and the number of stars and forks, alongside license information and age. The inclusion of average daily forks and stars provides insight into growth trends, and predefined categories like 'Tutorials' or 'Applications' help categorize each repository's purpose or domain within the field of Large Language Models (LLMs).

st.markdown("""The determination of whether a GitHub repository is open source primarily revolves around the type of license it is distributed under.
            
A repository is considered open source if it includes a license that complies with the Open Source Initiative (OSI) Open Source Definition. This definition includes several criteria, such as free redistribution, source code availability, derivative works permission, and no discrimination against persons or groups.
            
Common open-source licenses include the MIT License, Apache License 2.0, GNU General Public License (GPL)""")

# User inputs for weights
st.markdown(""" 
Determining the "most impactful" projects involves analyzing various metrics that reflect the project's popularity, or technical contribution. On platforms like GitHub, certain data points can serve as indicators of a project's impact. Here are two main criteria that the impact will be measured by:

1. Star Count
- What It Indicates: A high star count is often seen as a sign of the project's popularity and community approval.
- Limitations: Stars can sometimes reflect momentary interest rather than long-term value or impact.
2. Forks Count
- What It Indicates: Forks indicate other developers are interested in building upon or with the project. A high fork count suggests the project is a valuable resource or foundation within the community.
- Limitations: Not all forks lead to significant contributions or variations.
3. Age of Repository
- What It Indicates: The age or longevity of a project can indicate its enduring relevance and stability in the open-source community. Older projects have had more time to accumulate contributions, users, and recognition.
- Limitations: Age alone does not indicate quality or active maintenance. A project's recent activity should also be considered.
4. Repository Category
- What It Indicates: The category of a repository can provide insights into its domain of influence and typical use cases. It helps in understanding the sector of technology the project is impacting, whether it be web development, data science, machine learning, etc.
- Limitations: A repositoryâ€™s category doesn't measure its quality or influence directly. A project might be influential within a niche category or could be pioneering a new category of technology.

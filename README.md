# Sixfold Coding Challenge - ML Engineer/Data Scientist 

Our coding challenge is a self-directed project. Imagine that you are an aspiring ML engineer eager to showcase your knowledge in the exploding world of generative AI, particularly with regard to large language models (LLMs). That shouldn't be tough ðŸ˜€

**Your task is to build a dashboard to show the most impactful LLM-related open source software (OSS) projects.**

How you accomplish this is up to you. You might search GitHub with keywords like `generative AI`, `LLM`, or similar terms and filter the results by stars. Or you might come up with a different approach. Don't be afraid to get creative!

We have designed this challenge to be solvable in 2-3 hours for somebody with the requisite experience with data science and machine learning. You should not strive to implement production-quality software. Rather, this is your chance to showcase your skills by solving a real-world problem.

## Project environment

You must implement your project using Python 3. You may use any libraries and LLMs you'd like.

This repo is using Poetry for dependencies management, feel free to add the packages you will need.

## Functional requirements

Your implementation should include:

1. Data collection and processing
2. Modeling (you can use any machine learning techniques and/or LLMs you choose)
3. Visualization

You are expected to present basic stats, modeled features, distilled features, summaries, etc, for each OSS project. Keep in mind you are presenting your work to your CTO.

## Getting started

We provided a sample data file in this repo to help you get started, but you are free to collect your own data.

We also included a sample Python script to fetch data from GitHub, but again, you are free to use anything that works for you.

## Submitting your solution

Do your work on a branch. When youâ€™re ready to submit, open a pull request to the `main` branch. It will automatically be assigned to us for review.
